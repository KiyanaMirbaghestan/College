# College
College data for computational statistics
We want to see if some factors influence to scores of college students
Result is that :
income doesnt have effect
Distance: if college nearer the scores are lower
if parents went to college, students have better scores
student who lives in city have worse result
boys in average had worse result
except west part everyone were good
American and African had lower scores than others
Spanish students were better
students who have own house were worse than others
good income causes good result
lower vacancy causes better result, it is so weird
students who give higher tuition fee to college had better result
education had good impact on result as well.
